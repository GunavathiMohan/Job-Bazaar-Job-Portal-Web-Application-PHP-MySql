Job Portal Web Application
I developed a full-featured Job Portal web application that connects job seekers with employers. The system allows employers to post job openings and manage applications, while job seekers can search for jobs, view details, and apply online.

The application includes user authentication, job listing management, search and filter options, and an easy-to-use application process. Employers can add, edit, and delete job posts, while applicants can upload resumes and track their application status.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, following a clean and responsive UI design. Data is stored securely in the database, and all user interactions are handled dynamically.

The complete source code is hosted on GitHub, demonstrating version control practices and real-world project structure.
